# Class Intent Contracts README

This directory contains **Intent Contracts** as defined in ADR-006.

An Intent Contract is a human-readable, unambiguous declaration of:

- what a non-trivial class is meant to do,
- what it must never do,
- its invariants,
- and its failure semantics.

Intent Contracts are architectural artifacts.
They are not implementation documentation.

---

## When Is an Intent Contract Required?

An Intent Contract is mandatory for:

- Core domain classes
- Architectural boundary classes
- Orchestration components
- State-owning components
- Classes that enforce invariants
- Classes that modify semantics or transformation

Trivial value objects and pure utility functions do not require one.

## Structure of an Intent Contract

Each contract must define:

1. Purpose
2. Responsibility Boundary
3. Invariants
4. Explicit Non-Responsibilities
5. Failure Semantics
6. Observable Effects (if applicable)

Contracts must be clear enough that:

- Tests (ADR-005) can be derived from them.
- Architectural violations can be detected.
- Silicon-based agents cannot reinterpret intent (ADR-007).

## Active Contracts

No contracts yet. Create intent contracts as non-trivial classes arrive during extraction (PRs 1-8).

Likely first candidates:
- `ReportModule` -- report assembly orchestration
- `HistoricalLineGraph` -- time-series visualization with forecast overlays
- `PosteriorDistributionAnalyzer` -- Bayesian HDI/MAP statistical analysis
- `ReconciliationModule` -- spatial reconciliation via scipy optimization

---

## Governance Relationship

Intent Contracts are governed by:

- ADR-006 (Intent Contracts for Non-Trivial Classes)
- ADR-003 (Authority of Declarations)
- ADR-005 (Testing Doctrine)

If a class changes meaning, its Intent Contract must be updated.
